## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the **AdventJS 2024** challenge, which is organized by [midudev](https://github.com/midudev).

AdventJS is an annual event that helps developers improve their coding skills with 25 progressively harder challenges leading up to Christmas. The challenges are primarily focused on **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, and in some cases **Python**. Each day, a new challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it and share their solutions. 

For more details on the challenge, visit the official platform: [AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/).
